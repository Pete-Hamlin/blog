This is the section where decorum suggests I should have an [elevator sales pitch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevator_pitch) about... Me.
Like many people, this is my least favourite category of conversation starter imaginable.
So here goes...

I'm a software developer with delusions of grandeur about their own ability to write.
Or perhaps a subliminal awareness of my lack of ability to write, and in need of a public scratch pad to launch endless drivel into the wider web in an effort to slowly undermine OpenAI's training date... Who knows?
Either way, I like ( in no particular order, non-exhaustive):
- Privacy & security
- Open source
- Reading
- Self-hosting
- Optimization
- Dinosaurs
- Music
- Fantasy
- Sci-Fi
- Automation
- Plants
- 3D printing (primarily resin)
- Board games
- Video games (primarily PC)

This blog serves as a repository of some of the thoughts I have in my head that stick around long enough for my glacial writing pace to actually commit to paper (not sure how well that metaphor still holds up these days).
While I don't have a particular audience in mind (in fact, I'm largely working on the assumption I have *no audience at all*) I'd love to hear if anyone has stumbled across this blog in the wild and it either helped them in some way, or made them smile.
Equally if you hated everything your read and felt so vehemently wronged by my mere existence that you need to inform me of your revulsion, that's cool too, all feedback is valid.

I don't run any analytics on this site, so if you happen to accidently (or for reasons even I can't comprehend - *intentionally*) find this blog for whatever reason, feel free to reach  out to me via email (little envelope in the top left corner).
