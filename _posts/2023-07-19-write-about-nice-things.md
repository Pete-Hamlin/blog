Every now and then fate delivers a piece of evidence you really need to see, serendipitously just when you need to see it (or in Hollywood's case, this actually happens all the time).
So, as I was midway through a draft of my first longer form post, I stumbled across [Jim Nielsen's](https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/feed.xml) article on [Things I Like Over Things I Don't](https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2023/things-i-like-over-things-i-dont/).

I won't go through and lamely repeat what's already been said in Jim's post, though I recommend you check it out (and the [linked post](https://daverupert.com/2018/11/the-good-path/) by Dave Rupert) but it made me pause, and reflect on what kind of blogger I actually want to be.
Now I''m not saying that everything I planned to writing about would be dunking on some new trend or media I happen to dislike, but I couldn't help but feel there wasn't much lined up that I was genuinely *excited* or *happy* about. That's just a somewhat sorry state of affairs for a blog of exactly 3 posts.

It may just be that I've been harbouring a lot of negative sentiment recently, or maybe the piece I was working at the time on just happened to be somewhat critical, but I don't want to just be yet another voice of negativity on the internet. There's a time for criticism, but I think for now I should focus a little more on the good first before we explore the bad. Therefore, I think I will shelve some of the pieces I have in flight for a later date, and find some brighter topics to fill my headspace with.

Thanks Jim!
