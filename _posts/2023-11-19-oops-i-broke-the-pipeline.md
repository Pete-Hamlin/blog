Nothing highlights the futility of [writing to the void]({% post_url 2023-06-28-first-post %}#ok-but-why) quite like realising that the very posts you've written aren't even making it live.
To make matters worse, you yourself haven't even realised this for the best part of 3 months!

Anyway, it turns out the html linter that comes with the [Chirpy](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy) theme correctly highlighted I'd created a dud link in my [Hyperfocus review]({% post_url 2023-08-02-book-review-hyperfocus %}), and therefore was refusing to deploy.
The downside of this, was that I hadn't set up any alerting, so I was none the wiser.

**Whoops!**

Anyway, that issue has now been fixed, and the last 2 posts I've made have now (hopefully) magically appeared on the wider web as initially intended.
Not that this will really hide the lack of activity over the past 3 months... Life has been very busy and I've not had the time or place of mind to sit down and write recently.
I have a handful of ideas I want to put into writing, some of which is already being drafted up so hoping to get a slightly more regular cadence going again soon!
