Being a *relative* newbie to the linux desktop scene, with barely a decade under my belt, I still have the joy of stumbling across various easter eggs left in systems throughout the years.
[ILoveCandy](https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/8m2hy7/reminder_for_new_users_add_ilovecandy_in_your/) being a classic example of this in action (sadly, have not found anything similar for `apt` just yet).
Some people say it gets annoying after the novelty wears off. I don't see this happening yet, as I search for any reason to install packages just to see `pacman` do his thing.

Therefore, imagine my joy on finding [this section](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Sudo#Enable_insults) while innocently fixing other issues.
So now, whenever I cludge a `sudo` password, rather than being frustrated with this boring, polite notice:

```
[sudo] password for user: 
Sorry, try again.
```

I'm now greeted with this wonder:

```
[sudo] password for user:
You speak an infinite deal of nothing
```

Or one of many other options:

```
[sudo] password for user:
Speak English you fool -- there are no subtitles in this scene.
```

There really is nothing more to be said here - It's simply wonderful.
