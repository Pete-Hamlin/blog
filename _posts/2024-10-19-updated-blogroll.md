Just a quick post to earmark some changes to the formatting of the site, most notably on the [blogroll page](/blog/blogroll/).
I think keeping an active list of blogs I also follow is really important, and helps grow the overall blog-sphere organically (some of the best blogs I've found have been through other blogs' recommendations!)

The [template](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy) I initially stood this site up with didn't include a blogroll page, so I've currently been flying with this Frankenstein's monster of a page bolted together with some very shoddy html that didn't really fit with the rest of the theme (seriously, look at that thing...).

Naturally, this monstrosity that was only supposed to be a temporary placeholder hung around for over a year begging to be redone before I finally got round to doing so.
Borrowing from the sleek [Categories](/blog/categories/) template that *did* come included, the new blogroll now at last feels like it's actually part of the same site as the rest of it, which is nice!

As part of this overhaul, I also updated the list itself to include some new additions that I've decided to follow, enjoy!
You can find the [source code](https://github.com/Pete-Hamlin/blog/blob/master/_layouts/blogroll.html), and the [specific changes](https://github.com/Pete-Hamlin/blog/commit/5b1aeeac95e12e2eafd582ffc4240d3f59823306) here.

Now I just need to fix the [damn atom feed...]({% post_url 2023-07-10-fun-with-atom-feeds %})
