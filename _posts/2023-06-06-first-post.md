*"I should start a blog"*

I have to admit, the thought creeps into my mind univited with a surprising frequency.
Often this correlates with when I stumble across an article in someone else's blog that I find either informative or funny, and that dumbass voice at the back of my mind pipes up ad says "I could totally do that!".
This enthusiasm is usually quickly quashed when, either after loosing an hour or so browsing blogging platforms for that theme that feels *just right*, or staring at a blank screen for 15 minutes expecting inspiration to strike me like some form of divine intervention - I realise that I absolutely can't.

I've even made a few abortive attempts at doing so before, stumbling through a handful of mind numbing posts desperate to be either witty or relevant (usually succeeding at neither), which have invariably collapsed into nothing after a couple of months at most due to neglect.
Perhaps this attempt is just the most recent entry in that catalogue of disappointment, who knows?
Either way, I find myself once again inexplicably drawn back to the keyboard the vomit some words of questionable wisdom into a document, and then release them out to the wider internet.

## But... Why?

OK, so digging deeper, it's honestly a pretty good question.
Indeed, in the age of chatGPT producing works of staggeringly well written bullshit, one could question why the internet needs another random blog of dubious quality.
Maybe it's a neat way to pull some of my thoughts out of my head and transferring them to 'paper'?
Perhaps it's that self indulgent smug feeling I get while I sit there producing 'writing' on the train while others (assumedly) scroll away endlessly on social media?

I like to think one of the reasons is at least:

**I want to write.**

It's always been something I've wanted to be good at, and get into the habit of practicing frequently (I'm very envious of those who find the willpower to write daily).

But writing... is hard.
Therefore, I frequently find it gets pushed way down the procrastination ladder, until I magically run out of day and have still not managed to type a single word.
It takes time and energy out of your day to write, and even on the rare occasion I get round to it, 90% of what I produce is utter trash that I immediately delete in disgust after reading it (yeah, that self indugent smugness never lasts long...).
Writing is a skill, and like any skill, the best way to get good at it is to practice it as much as you can·.

So here I am (again).
I don't really·know what direction this blog is likely to go in at this point, or indeed if it will even last more than the standard month or two of its predecessors.
But hey, perhaps it will provide a space for my thoughts, and a medium to practice articulating them to no-one in particular.
Maybe it will even one day lead to me feeling **good** about writing.

So yeah... I should start a blog.
