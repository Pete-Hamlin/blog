So it seems I'm on a bit of a productivity book binge at the moment, as fresh on the heels of [Atomic Habits]({% post_url 2023-07-08-book-review-atomic-habits %}), I found myself diving right into *Hyperfocus: How to manage your attention in a world of distraction* by Chris Bailey.

Another pleasantly short book, that can more or less be divided into 2 halves, 

## Synopsis


While Atomic Habits focuses on the small things, and building up good, regular habits, Hyperfocus deals in methods to handle more involved tasks, such as day to day work.
The author explores 2 key areas in the form of **hyperfocus** (for intense/productivity related problems that occupy your entire attention), and the alter ego **scatterfocus** (to allow your brain to recharge, and to generate/connect new ideas).

While the 2 core topics are definitely interesting, and the book carries some solid advice for those struggling to dive deep into their focus related work, I did have some difficulties remaining engaged with the content of the book at time. I do however appreciate the irony of struggling to remain focused on a book about focus, which the book itself presciently points out at multiple points.

## Key Points

Overall, I'd say the key takeaways for me were:
- **Pick 3 Targets**: This has been the biggest force multiplier for me. I already keep quite an extensive TODO list, however identifying 3 items on it each even to complete the next day has massively helped me in churning through tasks. Doesn't matter how small/big the tasks are, just aim to complete 3 of them (and don't set more than 3, however feel free to complete more than that should the feeling take you on the day)
- **Give your brain dedicated recharge time**: This one seems fairly obvious, but I'm now taking more active steps to include in my daily routine. Give yourself breaks between intense focus sessions, and promote opportunities for your mind to wander more.
- **Meditate**: Another champion for the benefits of meditation, this time in the scope of improving focus. It provided enough compelling evidence that maybe I should try meditating in the mornings once again.

## Conclusion

I'd say, while Hyperfocus wasn't exactly groundbreaking for me, the book was still *good*.
There are still valuable points that I've taken away from the book and added to my daily routine.
If you're a fan of the genre, I'd definitely say it's worth a read, but I feel it's unlikely to change your life dramatically.
