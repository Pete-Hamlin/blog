    Honestly I just love Tim Urban's style and humour, as well as his ability to articulate complex emotional topics in a fun and relatable way. 
    Infrequent posts, but always worth a read whenever they come around

    Another infrequent poster, but I really enjoy Ben's honesty and willingness to share his experiences and mistakes through an impressive tech career.

    Definitely of a catharsis read for me, Ed doesn't pull the punches when it comes to highlighting some of the societal issues within the tech/business space.
    Definitely worth a look for those who hold a somewhat dim view of some of the tech moguls of the world.
